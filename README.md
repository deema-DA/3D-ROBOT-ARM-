# 3D-Robotic-ARM
# Robotic Arm 3D Design
This project contains a 3D robotic arm design created using Onshape.

The model was developed to gain a better understanding of mechanical design principles and 3D simulation.
# Tools Used
Onshape: for designing and assembling mechanical parts.

Parametric Design: applied for flexible modifications of dimensions and components.
# Components of the Robotic Arm
Base: provides stability and support.

Joints: enable rotational movement and directional control.

Arms/Links: interconnected segments for reach and flexibility.

# Features
Flexible and customizable parametric design.

Can be extended with servo motors or stepper motors for a functional prototype.

Multi-axis motion capability to simulate real robotic arm behavior.
